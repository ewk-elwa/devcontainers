# Expected Feedback

## 1. Resource Management
  -	The code correctly uses std::shared_ptr to manage the Item objects. This avoids manual memory management and potential memory leaks.
  -	However, if the ItemManager will always have exclusive ownership of the Item objects, std::unique_ptr would be more appropriate for better performance and stricter ownership semantics.

## 2. Inefficient Searching
  -	The findItemById function has a linear time complexity because it uses std::find_if on a std::vector. This could become a bottleneck as the number of items grows.
  -	Suggested improvement: Use a std::unordered_map<int, std::shared_ptr<Item>> for items_ instead of std::vector, which allows constant-time lookup by ID.

## 3. Const-Correctness
  -	The findItemById function is non-const, but it does not modify the state of the ItemManager class. Marking it as const would improve const-correctness:
```cpp
std::shared_ptr<Item> findItemById(int id) const;
```


## 4. Parameter Passing
  -	The addItem function takes a std::shared_ptr<Item> by value, which causes an unnecessary copy. It should accept the parameter as a const std::shared_ptr<Item>& to avoid extra overhead:
```cpp
void addItem(const std::shared_ptr<Item>& item);
```


## 5. Error Handling
  -	The code assumes that Item IDs are unique, but there’s no check in addItem to prevent adding multiple items with the same ID.
  -	Suggested improvement: Before adding an item, check if an item with the same ID already exists.

## 6. Use of Magic Numbers
  -	The hardcoded IDs in main (e.g., 1, 2, 3) could be replaced with constants or enums to make the code easier to read and maintain.

## 7. Logging and Debugging
  -	The printItems function directly outputs to std::cout, which tightly couples the function to the console. This makes the class harder to reuse in non-console applications.
  -	Suggested improvement: Pass an output stream as a parameter to the printItems function:
```cpp
void printItems(std::ostream& os = std::cout) const;
```


## 8. Missing Exception Handling
  -	There is no error handling for potential exceptions. For instance, if memory allocation fails, the program might crash. While this is generally rare, robust systems should account for such scenarios.

## 9. Use of Modern C++ Features
  -	The code could benefit from using std::make_unique (if switched to std::unique_ptr) for creating Item objects, which would align better with modern C++ practices.

## 10. General Design Considerations
  -	The ItemManager class doesn’t provide a way to remove items, which might be a limitation in practical use cases.
  -	The Item class has no mechanism for updating its attributes (e.g., name). If such functionality is required, appropriate member functions should be added.
